# Caption-Generator
Cloud technologies are making their way in every field. This caption generator utilizes a Computer Vision API provided by Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. In this project, I have utilized the API to implement a Caption Generator. Then we use Parrot package for paraphrasing the generated caption and generate multiple captions with it. <br><br>
Needless to say that this project wouldn't have been possible without the amazing work of <b>Prithviraj Damodaran</b>.<br>
  <br> You would need to run this command to install the necessary dependencies in your python environment:  pip install git+https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Parrot.git <br>
